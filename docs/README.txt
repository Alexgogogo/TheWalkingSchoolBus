As we're a group of 2 we were recommended to do only the gamification part

This is what was implemented:

Gamification
---------------
- As a student, I want the app to reward me for how often I walk with my group. Each time I complete a 
  walk with my group I earn one or more points (each team decides how to reward users with points). 


- As a student (and possibly a group leader), I want to earn points each time I walk with my group. In 
  the app I can prominently see my current points that I can spend, and I can spend my points on in-app 
  rewards. In the app I can go look at my currently 'purchased' rewards, and up-coming rewards that I 
  could buy. Things I might want to spend points on include:
   * app customization, such as new backgrounds, new colour schemes, new in-app icons,
   * buying stickers in game to drag onto a virtual sticker book,
   * avatar icons and glorious titles like "dragon slayer" or "butterfly catcher",
   * or other ideas! 
(Teams can pick what reward structure they want to setup, be it one of these suggestions or something 
 else. You are encouraged to be creative and come up with ways to motivate the students. Rewards must be 
 at least as challenging to implement as an above suggestion. This is how the user will be motivated, so 
 make sure you draw the user in with this!)

   
- As a user, I can view a leader board showing the total number of points each user has earned over the 
  lifetime of using the app (not just the number of points they currently have to spend). The leader board 
  shows the first name and first letter of the last name for each user, along with how many points the 
  user has earned over their lifetime of using the app. The leader board shows all users (not just ones in 
  my walking group), and is sorted from highest-points to lowest points. It is fine if the leader board 
  only shows the top 100 users (or so) if that makes more sense from an app design point of view.


- As a developer, I can use the provided web-page to manually award points to users for testing (or TA 
  marking!) -- DONE FOR YOU!
